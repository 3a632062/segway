# Segway
This repository holds code for robots that balance on two wheels, made with various robotics platforms.

## Currently available platforms

- LEGO MINDSTORMS EV3 (ev3dev/Python):
  - [Building instructions](http://robotsquare.com/2014/06/23/tutorial-building-balanc3r/)
  - Add a Touch Sensor to Port 1. I added it just like the Gyro, but on the other side of the brick. This will be the program's safe stop button.
  - Run the program like any other ev3dev Python program
     - Transfer and [segway.py](https://github.com/laurensvalk/segway/raw/master/ev3/ev3dev/python/segway.py) and [parameters.py](https://github.com/laurensvalk/segway/raw/master/ev3/ev3dev/python/parameters.py) to your EV3, and put them in the same directory.
     - To turn them into executable scripts, run:
        - chmod +x segway.py
     - Now you can run the program: ./segway.py   
     - Or, use the [VS Code IDE](https://github.com/ev3dev/vscode-ev3dev-browser) for convenience.
     - Wait for the program to start (up to 10 seconds)
     - Hold segway up right with its resting wheels on the ground and press the Touch Sensor
     - Press the Touch Sensor again to stop. Then again to restart, if you like.
